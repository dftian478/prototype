            <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>Alauda provides a published product life cycle for Alauda Container Platform ("ACP"), in order for customers and partners to effectively plan, deploy, and support their infrastructure. Alauda publishes this life cycle in an effort to provide as much transparency as possible and may make exceptions from these policies as conflicts may arise.</p>
            <p>Alauda Container Platform v3 provides a time-delineated, phased life cycle, where in at least 4 minor versions can be supported at any time. The time period of support is fixed from the point of minor version release and offers varying levels of support and maintenance. Alauda aims to forecast releases at a 3 month cadence, providing customers ample opportunity to plan.</p>
            <p>All released errata will remain accessible to active subscribers across the entire life cycle.</p>
