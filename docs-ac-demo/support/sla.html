            <ol class="terms-list">
                <li><p>The start date of the service period is based on the contract. If there is no agreement in the contract, the first term shall be counted from the date when Alauda provides the corresponding product license to the customer. Renewal of the contract starts from the day after the termination of the last service period. Before the agreed date, Alauda will not provide any service.</p></li>
                <li><p>Once the service starts, it will be calculated continuously. At the beginning of each year, both parties agree on the number of virtual cores included in the service scope. If the number of virtual cores used by the customer in the following year exceeds the agreed number, the customer will be charged according to the increased number of virtual cores in his/her current year.</p></li>
                <li><p>Upon expiration of the service, if the contract is not renewed, Alauda will stop the service. If the customer renews the contract after a certain period of time, in addition to paying for the new service period, the customer must also make up the full amount of the non-renewed period according to the number of cores used at the time of renewal.</p></li>
                <li><p>The service is subject to the <a href="lifecyclepolicy.html">Alauda product lifecycle</a>. In order to ensure that customers fully enjoy the services promised by Alauda, customers are requested to contact Alauda to agree on upgrading to a new version before the end of the lifecycle of the corresponding version Based on the above rules, we plan the lifecycle plan for each product and software version. These plans will be communicated to you at the time of purchasing, service communication, etc., and you will be notified via email, phone, Customer Portal (Alauda Cloud), etc., at least 3 months prior to the key milestones in the lifecycle of the product and software version.</p>
                    <p>More importantly, we want you to participate in the lifecycle management activities. You can give us feedback on your product and release lifecycle expectations during product roadmap communication. We'd also like to help you assess network operational risks and discuss solutions before discontinuing sales or services. We hope that through effective communication we can work together to pace product iterations and upgrades, and enjoy maximizing the social value that comes from adhering to this natural law.</p>
                    <p>Please promptly communicate any questions or comments regarding product lifecycle management to your sales representative or service representative.</p>
                </li>
               <li><p>For external open source softwares running on Alauda, if a failure occurs, Alauda will do its best to provide you with guidance and advice on industry best practices during the product service period, the response may not be able to meet the service level guarantees promised by the original softwares, and our response will only help you as a reference for decision-making; if the failure involves the open source software's own code, we will provide the latest fixes to the customer as soon as possible after it is available from the relevant open source community. External open source softwares availability indicators are consistent with the open source community.</p></li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Severity Level Definitions</h2>
            <p>Opening a support case online can make it easier to share technical data, error messages, and system information with your support representative. Following the online submission with a phone call can reduce response time as well as potential errors in the capture of information.</p>
            <p>Alauda recommends that you follow any Severity 1 and 2 online support case submissions with a phone call to support center.</p>
            <p>Alauda Support Services uses the following definitions to classify issues:</p>

            <table class="sla-table severity-table">

                        <p>Issues affect the release or access to applications in the production environment, resulting in a complete loss of the customer's ability to process business. Examples include:</p>

                            <li>Critical production issues affecting all customers, including service unavailability and data integrity issues, with no resolution.</li>
                            <li>The service crashes or hangs indefinitely, resulting in unacceptable or indefinite delays in resources or responses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Severity 1 issues related to service disruptions or not, as determined by the customer, require that the customer have dedicated resources available to address the issue on an ongoing basis or the severity level will be reduced to Severity 2.</p>
